# Technical Documentation

This document provides technical details about the IR Image Classification system, including architecture, algorithms, and implementation considerations.

## System Architecture

The IR Image Classification system follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

1. **Image Processing Pipeline**: Handles IR image loading, validation, and preprocessing
2. **Embedding Extraction**: Extracts feature vectors from IR images using deep learning models
3. **Vector Database**: Stores and indexes embeddings for efficient similarity search
4. **Query Processing**: Processes queries and ranks results based on similarity and confidence
5. **User Interface**: Provides a web-based interface for interacting with the system
