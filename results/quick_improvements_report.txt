APPLIED IMPROVEMENTS:
----------------------------------------
  âœ… embedding_extraction: Enhanced with IR-specific normalization
  âœ… similarity_conversion: Enhanced with IR-specific boosting
  âœ… similarity_calculation: Enhanced IR-specific similarity boosting applied
  âœ… confidence_calculation: Enhanced with reduced penalties and IR-specific scaling
  âœ… confidence_threshold: Reduced from 0.250 to 0.200
  âœ… search_results: Increased from 5 to 10
  âœ… distance_metric: Set to cosine (was cosine)

EXPECTED BENEFITS:
----------------------------------------
  ðŸŽ¯ Higher similarity scores for IR images
  ðŸŽ¯ More confident predictions
