# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an IR (Infrared) Image Classification Tool that uses deep learning embeddings for military object identification. The system will leverage pre-trained CNN models (ResNet50) or Vision Language Models (Qwen) to extract embeddings from IR query images, perform similarity searches against a vector database, and return the top 5 most similar objects. The system is designed for military applications requiring high precision, local data storage, and the ability to work with IR imagery showing white objects on black backgrounds.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a military analyst, I want to upload an IR query image and receive the top 5 most similar objects from our database, so that I can quickly identify unknown objects in the field.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an IR image THEN the system SHALL extract embeddings using a fine-tuned model
2. WHEN embeddings are extracted THEN the system SHALL perform similarity search against the vector database
3. WHEN similarity search is complete THEN the system SHALL return the top 5 most similar objects with confidence scores
4. WHEN results are returned THEN the system SHALL display similarity scores with at least 95% precision for known object classes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a data scientist, I want to create a comprehensive dataset from 3k base images expanded to 15-18k images through augmentation, so that I can train a robust model for IR object classification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes the base dataset of 3k IR images THEN it SHALL apply data augmentation techniques to generate 15-18k total images
2. WHEN augmentation is applied THEN the system SHALL preserve the IR characteristics (white objects on black background)
3. WHEN augmentation is complete THEN the system SHALL maintain object integrity and military relevance
4. WHEN the dataset is created THEN the system SHALL organize images with proper labeling and metadata

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a machine learning engineer, I want to fine-tune a pre-trained model (ResNet50 or Qwen VLM) on military IR images, so that the embeddings are optimized for IR object classification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fine-tuning begins THEN the system SHALL use either ResNet50 CNN or Qwen VLM as the base model
2. WHEN training on IR military images THEN the system SHALL optimize for embedding quality specific to IR characteristics
3. WHEN fine-tuning is complete THEN the system SHALL achieve validation accuracy of at least 95% on held-out test set
4. WHEN model is trained THEN the system SHALL save the fine-tuned model weights locally for deployment

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all embeddings and indexes stored locally in a vector database, so that sensitive military data remains secure and accessible offline.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN embeddings are generated THEN the system SHALL store them in a local vector database
2. WHEN vector database is populated THEN the system SHALL create efficient indexes for fast similarity search
3. WHEN data is stored THEN the system SHALL ensure all military image data remains on local infrastructure
4. WHEN system is deployed THEN the system SHALL function completely offline without external dependencies

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a military operator, I want the system to provide high-precision results with fast query response times, so that I can make critical decisions quickly in operational scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a similarity query is performed THEN the system SHALL return results within 2 seconds
2. WHEN results are provided THEN the system SHALL achieve precision of at least 95% for top-5 recommendations
3. WHEN multiple queries are made THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance under concurrent load
4. WHEN system is in use THEN the system SHALL log all queries and results for audit purposes


### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to evaluate and compare different embedding models and vector database configurations, so that I can optimize system performance for IR military applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN model evaluation is performed THEN the system SHALL support comparison between ResNet50 and Qwen VLM embeddings
2. WHEN vector database is configured THEN the system SHALL allow testing different similarity metrics and indexing strategies
3. WHEN performance testing is conducted THEN the system SHALL measure and report precision, recall, and query latency
4. WHEN optimization is complete THEN the system SHALL document the best configuration for deployment
